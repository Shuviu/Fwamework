## Description

This is a small and simple "framework" that should make developing Terminal based games using C++ easier. <br>
Note that this is an educational project only. <br>
I have no intentions on keeping this up do date or maintaining it. Especially as the code written is most likely rather unpleasant <br>

## Installation

For installation my other library for TerminalUtilities is needed. Aka. this one: https://github.com/Shuviu/CppTerminalUtils
